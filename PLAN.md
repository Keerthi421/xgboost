# Plan for Making XGBoost Tutorials Multi-Language

## Background
Issue #11413 requests making all tutorials multi-language, by adding R code to the existing Python tutorials. This will allow users to select their preferred language when reading the documentation.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Setup and Dependencies
- Ensure sphinx-panels is installed (already done)
- Verify that the language tabs functionality works as expected

### 2. Create a To-Do List of Tutorials to Convert
- Identify all tutorials in the doc/tutorials directory
- Prioritize based on importance and complexity
- Create a checklist to track progress

### 3. Template Development
- Create a standard template for how Python and R sections should be structured
- Ensure consistent formatting and style between language examples

### 4. Conversion Process for Each Tutorial
For each tutorial:
1. Read and understand the Python implementation
2. Create equivalent R code that demonstrates the same concepts
3. Integrate R code using the tabbed structure
4. Test to ensure the R code works as expected
5. Submit as individual PR or batched updates

### 5. Testing and Documentation
- Test both Python and R code snippets
- Update any language-specific documentation references
- Ensure correct rendering in the documentation website

### 6. PR Submission Process
- Submit PRs in manageable batches to facilitate easier review
- Include clear descriptions of changes made
- Link to the original issue #11413

## Implementation Notes
- Some tutorials may not be applicable to R (e.g., distributed mode)
- Ensure that examples use equivalent datasets available in both Python and R
- Keep code samples focused and clear
- Follow R coding conventions for the R examples
